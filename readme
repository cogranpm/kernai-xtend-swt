this project is based on a windowbuilder template to get
eclipse databinding working and swt this is a non rcp attempt
wnat to make it a java project jigsaw compatible so eventually can deploy with minimal jre included


xtend overview:
lamdas
property style instead of setter
extension methods:
operator overloading: use certain name of a function

@Data annotation
creates an immutable value class
gettter methods
hashcode and equals
tostring
constructor with all fields

@Data class looks like:
@Data class Movie {
      String title
      int year
      double rating
      long numberOfVotes
      Set<String> categories
}

how about a regular class:

class Movies {

      val someImmutableVar
      //val means final
      

}

xtend runtime library:
basically have to look in the source code: https://github.com/eclipse/xtext-lib/blob/master/org.eclipse.xtext.xbase.lib/src/org/eclipse/xtext/xbase/lib/CollectionLiterals.java
seems to have stuff like newImmutableMap()
immutable list:val a = #['Hello', 'World'] or for an array: val String[] a = #['Hello', 'World']
immutable set: val a =  #{'Hello', 'World'}
immutable map: val a = #{'a' -> 1, 'b' -> 2}
